    <h1>Summary for CSS Library</h1>
    <p>CSS libraries are pre-written collections of CSS code and styles you can use to quickly and easily style your web projects. They are reusable components created by developers to help solve common issues.</p>
    <p>They typically include styles for common elements such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars. They may also have styles for more specialized elements, such as graphs, charts, animations, etc.</p>

    <h2>1. Bootstrap</h2>
    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS, and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>

    <h2>2. Tailwind CSS</h2>
    <p>Tailwind is a "utility-first CSS framework" that provides classes enabling users to create custom user interfaces directly within the user's markup. Implementing inline styling is helpful for quickly creating an eye-catching UI without coding any CSS.</p>
