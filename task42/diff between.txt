1. Expression:

Expressions are like phrases in a sentence. They represent computations that resolve to a single value. Think of mathematical operations, variable assignments, or function calls that return something.

2 + 3 is an expression; it evaluates to 5.

"Hello" + " World" is an expression; it evaluates to "Hello World".

myFunction() is an expression if myFunction returns a value.

x > 5 is an expression; it evaluates to true or false.


2. Statemet:

Statements are like complete sentences. They perform an action or a series of actions. While expressions can be part of a statement, a statement itself doesn't necessarily produce a value that you can use in another part of your code directly.

let x = 10; is a statement. It declares a variable and assigns a value. The assignment x = 10 is an expression within this statement.

if (condition) { /* code */ } is a statement. It controls the flow of execution.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { /* code */ } is a statement. It defines a loop.

console.log("Result: " + value); is a statement. It prints something to the console.



Essentially, all expressions are statements, but not all statements are expressions. When an expression is used on its own, it becomes an "expression statement." For example, 10 + 5; is an expression statement. It calculates 15, but because it's not assigned or used, the value is just discarded.
